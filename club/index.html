<h1>Arduino Club</h1>

<p>
The "/club" sector of this website will be used to log the progress of the "Arduino Club" at our school.
</p>

<p>
At the time of creation, we are in the middle of our first project: a classic snake game on an 8x8 matrix of LEDs.
</p>

<p>
The code for this first project can be seen over on <a href="https://github.com/RoadKillCat/LEDMatrixSnake">github</a>.

<h1>Arduino Club</h1>

<p>
At the end of the 2017 Summer Term, I was granted some money to start a club revolving around Arduinos. We currently meet on Wednesday and Friday lunchtimes and work on projects together.
</p>

<p>
To keep track of what we spend the money on, <a href='https://joeiddon.github.io/club/log'>this page</a> contains a table of things we've bought.
</p>

<p>
The images below are linked to their corresponding projects so feel free to take a look at what we have been up to.
</p>

<p>
All the code we have written is available <a href='https://github.com/joeiddon/arduino_club'>here on GitHub</a>.

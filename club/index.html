<h1>Arduino Club</h1>

<p>
The "/club" sector of this website will be used to log the progress of the "Arduino Club" which I was granted some money by the school to run. <a href="http://joeiddon.me/club/log">This page</a> will be used to track our expenditures.

<h2>
Our First Project: a classic snake game on a matrix of LEDs.
</h2>

<p>
To get used to how the group would work, we decided to begin with something that wouldn't be too challenging, but would create something cool.
</p>

<p>
To start with, we used a pre-built LED matrix that would focus our attention on the software (programming the game) rather than the hardware.
</p>

<p>
After a couple of weeks we managed to get the core design of the snake game working well using some little push switches for inputs.
</p>

<p>
The Arduino sketch for this can be seen over on <a href="https://github.com/RoadKillCat/LEDMatrixSnake">github</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here it is working:

<p>
Now that we had the thing working connected by loose wires, we decided that it would be nice to have a finnished product that was one device. For this, we all needed to be able to solder and this would be a valuable skill for us in the future, so I gave a little demonstration, and everyone picked it up straight away.
</p>

<p>
We were now ready to get the components together to build the final product - the main being a more compact matrix. We brought an unsoldered one off ebay quite cheaply, but it required us to solder it together including the miniscule surface-mount chip.

And here are some pictures of our work soldering it together:

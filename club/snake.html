<h1>A Classic Snake Game</h1>

<p>
To get used to how the group would work, we decided to begin with something that wouldn't be too challenging, but would create something cool.
</p>

<p>
We used a MAX7219 8x8 LED matrix for the display as it would allow us for enough resolution to play the game, but is fairly inexpensive. To start with, we just wired it up loosely to an Arduino so we could focus our attention on the software (programming the game) rather than the hardware.
</p>

<p>
After a couple of weeks we managed to get the core design of the snake game working well using some little push switches for inputs.
</p>

<p>
The Arduino sketch (code) for this can be seen over on <a href="https://github.com/RoadKillCat/LEDMatrixSnake">github</a>.
</p>

<p>
We were prototyping with an Arduino Mega and a breadboard connected with some jumpers:

<p>
Now that we had the thing working, we decided that it would be nice to have a finished product that was one device. For this, we needed to be able to solder (to make a proper controller) and this would be a valuable skill for us in the future, so I gave a quick demonstration, and everyone picked it up straight away.
</p>

<p>
Next, we got the components together to build the final product - the main thing being a more compact matrix. We brought an unsoldered one off ebay quite cheaply, but it required us to solder it together including a miniscule surface-mount chip.

<p>
And here are some pictures of our work soldering it together:

<p>
However, after soldering the different components onto the board, we realised that to make the project as small as possible, it would make sense to just use the larger matrix as this had enough space to mount everything on. So even though this was a valuable lesson on soldering, we ended up <b>not</b> using it!
</p>

<p>
Next, we made the controller board by soldering some push buttons to some copper stripboard. This then needed to be connected to the Arduino Nano, along with the LED matrix.
</p>

<p>
And that was pretty much it! We uploaded the sketch to the Nano that we had already got working for the Mega (the code is compatible between board types in this case) and that was it. Here are some photos of the finished product, and finally a video of it in action.

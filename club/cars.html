<h1>Cars</h1>

<p>The rough idea for this project is to build 4 cars (small groups working on each).</p>

<p>Each car will follow the same rough design: front-wheel drive with 2 DC Motors which we bought with built-in gearboxes, a third caster wheel at the back for stabilisation and enough room to mount an Arduino Uno/Nano and a Raspberry Pi 3.</p>

<p>As with the hexapod, we decided to take advantage of the school laser cutter to manufacture the frames. Two of the designs were just one piece - a basic frame that the wheels can be glued/screwed to the bottom of and enough space on the top to mount th electronics. The other two designs built upon this idea - adding sides and tops which will be glued together to conceal the electronics and make the final outcome more robust.</p>

<p>Here is a screenshot of the final designs which took about 2 meetings to do:</p>

<p><em>*note to self, take a screenshot</em></p>

<p>We then laser cut them:</p>

<p><strong>WARNING: The next video is in portrait which is horrible,</strong> however I thought the coolness of the cutting made up for it.</p>

<p>However, unfortunately, when we were tuning the power settings of the laser cutter, we had been doing so by testing cutting a small circle. This proved to be a different type of cut to trying to cut something larger (especially long straight lines). As a result, not all of the parts had <em>fully</em> been cut out.</p>

<p>This was no issue however, we just popped them out (sometimes with the addition of some significant force):</p>

<p>And that was the frames finnished!</p>

<p><em>sorry for the non-orthogonal arrangement, it was a rushed picture!</em></p>

<p>Then, as some glued their "roofs" together, the others got to soldering the motors:</p>

<p>And that's our current progress.</p>

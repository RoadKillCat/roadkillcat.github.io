<h1>Javascript?</h1>

<p>
Javascript is seen to many as "the scripting language of the web" and thats how I first saw it. Sure, it is useful for creating
websites like this one (the dropdown menu and stuf was done in javascript), but now I see that it is a powerful coding tool.
The main thing that I have used it with is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API"> HTML canvas </a>.
For example one of my first things I coded in it was this prime distribution graph. Yeah, this would have been easier in python or
something, but not as graphical and not as cool. 
Here it is:

It may not seem amazing, but this example shows how javascript isnt just useful for creating websites. Just look at the code for
the prime calculations:

<pre>
function primeSieve(limit){
	flags = []
	for (i = 0; i < limit ; i++){
		flags.push(true)
	}
	flags[0] = false
	flags[1] = false
	primes = []
	for (index = 0; index < limit; index ++){
		if (flags[index] == true) {
			primes.push(index)
			for (n = index * index ; n < limit ; n += index){
					flags[n] = false
			}
		}
	}
	return primes
}
</pre>

The function is near idential to the same function written in python: 

<pre>
def primeSieve(limit):
	flags = [True] * limit
	flags[0] = flags[1] = False
	primes = []
	for (index, flag) in enumerate(flags):
		if flag:
			primes.append(index)
			for n in range(index * index, limit, index):
				flags[n] = False
	return primes
</pre>

In this example of calculating primes, it can be seen that javascript performs well and this demonstrates some of its usage outside of web devolplment. In addition, it may come as a surprise that here the javascript function is more efficent at calculating the primes than the python one (i.e computes in less time). This goes to show how it is a great tool and, as you can see in my projects where I have used it, can be extremely powerful for visualising things.

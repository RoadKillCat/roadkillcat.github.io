<h1>Creating Perlin Noise in JS</h1>
<script src='https://joeiddon.github.io/perlin/perlin.js'></script>

<em>Article updated 2021 to improve usefulness for future visitors.</em>

<p>
Perlin noise is a term for a particular smooth, natural-looking randomness and
the associate  algorithm used to generate it. The output is particularly useful
in computer graphics where it can be employed in textures, flames, smoke, and
terrain - what I will be using it for. The most well known place Perlin noise
is implemented is Minecraft where it is used generate the landscape so the
hills, caves and so
on.
</p>

<p>
Following <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise'>the
Wikipedia article on this topic</a>, I managed to successfully write code to
generate it. These are the steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Define an n-dimensional grid.
<li>For each node of the grid assign a random gradient vector of unit length in n dimensions.
<li>Given an n-dimensional argument for the noise function.
<li>Determine its cell in the grid.
<li>For each corner node of that cell, calculate the distance vector between
the point and the node.
<li>Compute the dot product between the gradient vector and the distance
vector.
<li>Interpolate the 2^n dot products to get the value.
</ol>

<p>Of course we will be generating two-dimensional (n = 2) noise. [On a side
note, there is <a href='https://youtu.be/obCjODeoLVw?t=148'>a good clip of
Richard Feynman making a joke</a> about Mathematicians always generalising to
n-dimensions, but Physicist wanting the real world, so the mathematician says
to "substitute n equals three!".]<p>

<p>
The result (always start from the end) is seen below - a comparison with
static noise on the left, and the Perlin noise on the right.

var pixSize = cnvs.width / resolution

for (var y = 0; y < gridSize; y += gridSize / resolution){
    for (var x = 0; x < gridSize; x += gridSize / resolution){
        var v = parseInt(Math.random() * 255)
        ctx.fillStyle = 'rgb(' + v + ',' + v + ',' + v + ')'
        ctx.fillRect(x * (cnvs.height / gridSize), y * (cnvs.height / gridSize), pixSize, pixSize)
    }
}

for (var y = 0; y < gridSize; y += gridSize / resolution){
    for (var x = 0; x < gridSize; x += gridSize / resolution){
        var v = parseInt(perlin.get(x, y) * 255)
        ctx.fillStyle = 'rgb(' + v + ',' + v + ',' + v + ')'
        ctx.fillRect(cnvs.height + x * (cnvs.height / gridSize), y * (cnvs.height / gridSize), pixSize, pixSize)
    }
}

<p>Okay so how do we write this in JavaScript? First we will write it the
straightforward way, then we will optimise it for efficiency and
simplicity.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> We need a two-dimensional grid. The size of this
grid determines roughly how zoomed in our noise is going to be.</p>

<p>In JavaScript, we can use an array for this. We will initialise it as empty,
and also define the size of it. This size determines how many nodes we have in
each dimension (a node is a point we interpolate between).</p>

<pre>
let grid = [];
let nodes = 8;
</pre>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Assign a random gradient vector of unit length to
each node of the grid.</p>

<p>A random gradient vector of unit length is simply a pair of numbers
<code>[x,y]</code> where the length of them is equal to one (I.e. <code>x^2 +
y^2 = 1</code>).</p>

<p>To generate a pair of numbers like these, it is easiest to use the sine and
cosine functions with a random angle, theta!</p>

<p>Let's make a function out for this. It will return the coordinate as an
object with <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> attributes.</p>

<p>To the right of the code below is a canvas element that is drawing vectors
created using this random function.</p>

<div style='display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content:space-between;
align-items: center;'>
<div><pre>
function random_unit_vector(){
    let theta = Math.random() * 2 * Math.PI;
    return {x: Math.cos(theta), y: Math.sin(theta)};
}
</pre></div>
<canvas id='cnvs1' style='border: 1px solid grey'></canvas>
<script>
var cnvs1 = document.getElementById('cnvs1');
cnvs1.width = cnvs1.height = 256;
var ctx1  = cnvs1.getContext('2d');
setInterval(function(){
var vector = perlin.rand_vect();
ctx1.beginPath();
ctx1.moveTo(cnvs1.width/2, cnvs1.height/2);
ctx1.lineTo(cnvs1.width/2 + vector.x * 100, cnvs1.height/2 + vector.y * 100);
ctx1.closePath();
ctx1.stroke();
}, 500);
</script>
</div>

<p>Now we need to populate the grid with these random vectors. A nested
for-loop is easiest to do this with.</p>

<pre>
for (let i = 0; i < nodes; i++) {
    let row = [];
    for (let j = 0; j < nodes; j++) {
        row.push(random_unit_vector());
    }
    grid.push(row);
}
</pre>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> We need to accept the input to the function a
two-dimensional argument.</p>

<p>Taking a step back - what functionality are we trying to provide here? The
Perlin noise algorithm describes a function. This takes an input of a
coordinate ("a two-dimensional argument"), and returns a number. The number
determines the height/intensity of the noise at that coordinate.</p>

<p>But how can a function that returns an intensity be used to create the
smooth image shown at the start of this article? The answer - the image is not
continuous, but discrete or "pixelated". So the image is created by iterating
over each pixel coordinate, running the Perlin function for that coordinate,
and assigning the intensity to that pixel.</p>

<p>Therefore we need a function. Lets call it <code>perlin_get</code>, and it
will take a two-dimensional input (x and y), and return an
<em>intensity</em>.</p>

<pre>
function perlin_noise(x, y) {
    ...
    return intensity;
}
</pre>

<p>
<strong>Step 4:</strong> Determine its cell in the grid, where the "cell" is
the square of nodes around our x and y. For example, if x = 1.4 and y = 3.6,
then the cell is from x = 1 to 2 and y = 3 to 4.
</p>

<p>
How do we do this in JavaScript? Well we can use the
<a
href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/floor'><code>Math.floor(...)</code></a>
function. [Improvements in 2021 end here for now. If this half of the article
reads better than the latter half, please leave an anonymous comment from my <a
href='https://joeiddon.github.io/'>homepage</a> to let me know my efforts have
helped your understanding.]
</p>

<pre>
var x0 = Math.floor(x);
var x1 = x0 + 1;
var y0 = Math.floor(y);
var y1 = y0 + 1;
</pre>

<p>
Having found the cell nodes, we can calculate the dot product between the distance vector between the point and the node and the random gradient vector from our array. Calculating the distance vector and the dot product can be condensed together into one function:
</p>

<pre>
function dot_prod_grid(x, y, vert_x, vert_y){
    var g_vect = gradients[vert_y][vert_x];
    var d_vect = {x: x - vert_x, y: y - vert_y};
    return d_vect.x * g_vect.x + d_vect.y * g_vect.y;
}
</pre>

<p>
Finally, we need to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation'>interpolate</a> between the four cell node dot-products (scalars). Interpolation is a way of constructing new data points within a range of others. To do this, a function is used, the simplest being linear:
</p>

<pre>
function lin_interp(x, a, b){
    return a + x * (b-a);
}
</pre>

<p>
So if we run linTerp(0, 56, 98) we will get 56 and if we run with x = 1 we get b so 98 in this case. The point of the interpolation is that now, any value of x will map between the two outer values. So running linTerp(0.5, 24, 64) will give us the value exactly in the middle so 44. However, linear interpolation produces slight 'ridges' inbetween each cell as their is no curves, just straight lines. To add a very rounded and smooth looking curve/ fade inbetween the cells, we can use Perlin's smootherstep function (a quintic polynomial):
</p>

<pre>
smootherstep: function(x){
    return 6*x**5 - 15*x**4 + 10*x**3;
},
interp: function(x, a, b){
    return a + smootherstep(x) * (b-a);
},
</pre>

<p>
To interpolate between the four cell nodes with this function, we must do so in three steps (bilenear interpolation). First by interpolating how far the x distance of the input is into the cell (between 0 and 1) between the top two dot-products and then interpolating the inputs x value into the cell again between the bottom two dot-products of the cell. Finally, interpolate between the two previous values to get the final value for that noise which will be returned from the library. Note that as the function returns a value between -1 and 1, and I would like it to return a value between 0 and 1, the final value is mapped to my range by incrementing and dividing by 2.

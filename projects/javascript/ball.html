<h1>An Interactive Rotating Ball</h1>

<h2><a href="/3dSimulationVR/ball">Check it out here</a></h2>

<p>After finishing my 3d engine to a reasnoble level, I thought I'd make a neat demonstration of its functionality.</p>

<p>All you can do is rotate the wireframe ball with your mouse. It is not that interesting, but was useful for me to get used to mapping mouse movements to rotation of an object. This could be useful in the future for some sort of 3d viewer (such as an stl one <a href="https://www.viewstl.com/">this one</a> that uses three.js.</p>

<p>The actual code for this was pretty short, all that needed to be done was generate the coordinates for a ball using the basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry">trig functions</a>. As a sidenote, that wikipedia articles was one of my inspirations for making it. From the following image, the sin() and cos() functions become suddenly so obvious. I was taught trigonometry from SOHCAHTOA and the methods of how to apply the funcitons to basic triangles (and then obviously this progressed to non-right angled trianges with the sine and cosine rules later), but when reading that article, felt as if there was a sizeable gap in my understanding of what they fundamentally meant. It makes so much sense now!</p>

<p>So now generating the coordinates that describe the sphere was simple, I just created a simple function (below) that takes a yaw and pitch angle and returns the coordinate at that point on a sphere with radius 1. The code is fairly self-explanatory and I believe to be fairly succinct.</p>

<p>Apart from the above function, the rest of the code is pretty simple and boring so I won't bother going into depth here. However, as always, feel free to checkout <a href="https://github.com/RoadKillCat/3dSimulationVR/blob/master/ball.html">the source</a> on github.</p>

<p>And that's it, there wasn't too much to this project, but it created a cool outcome, link at top!</p>

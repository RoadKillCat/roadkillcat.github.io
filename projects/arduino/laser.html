<h1>A Proof-Of-Concept LASER-LDR Sensor</h1>

<p>Most Arduino boards have analog pins which accurately sense 0-5V. A light dependent resistor (LDR) changes its resistance in iresponse to light. However, since the analog pins only measure voltage (and not resistance), a potential divider circuit is needed: (source wikipedia)</p>

<p>Once I could then get an accurate reading of the lots of things became possible. One useful thing being to couple this sensor with a LASER. I soldered together a little device that joined these two components together. This would allow me to test it in different applications.</p>

<p>From here, the main application I had in mind was making some kind of light gate. This would involve bouncing the light off a mirror and back at the LDR. Then, if the laserbeam is broken, the Arduino could carry out some task (for testing purposes I just lit the on-board LED (pin 13)) when the beam was active.</p>

<p>For the mirror itself, it had to be of high quality in order to create a clean reflection. Luckily I had a small rectangular segment that I salvaged from an old scanner.</p>

<p>Here is a video of me breaking the beam:</P>

<p>Finally, I realised that when the devide was held close to a solid surface, the reflection of the LASER's light off the surface was enough to be noticable by the Arduino. I modified the simple code (it was merely a THRESH #define) and now it worked as a proximity sensor!</p>

<p>A possible appication of this now (video below) would be on a small robot - one where an ultrasound sensor would be too large. The device could be incorporated easily and allow for autonomous navigation.</p>

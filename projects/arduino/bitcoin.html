<h1>Wireless bitcoin price display</h1>

<p>I had had one of these <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-huzzah-esp8266/overview">adafruit feathers</a> lying around which has a built-in ESP8266 wifi module. So I decided to test out its capabilities by making a quick little project that would display the current bitcoin price in binary on some rows of LEDs.</p>

<p>After reading up on the module, I setup a nodeJS server to practice some HTTP requests and get the board working.</p>

<p>I then needed to find a lightweight website that would allow me to extract the current price. I came across this <a href="http://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json">coindesk json api</a></p>

<p>After succesfully working out a way of extracting the price from that, I then worked on the LED display aspect. The price of bitcoin was roughly 8000 pounds, but having spiked on the 16th December to 14,592, I would need 14 bits to safely be able to display the full price (allowing me up to 16383).</p>

<p>However, as seen in the pinout of the board below, there were only 9 GPIO pins available. And so with 14 leds, I would need a different method, so I soldered them into a grid circuit (two rows of 7 leds) which would allow me to scan back and forth between the rows at a high speed and create the impression that the LEDs are constantly on. For this, I would then only need 8 of the 9 pins.</p>

<p>I tested the circuit with some jumpers:</p>

<!--<p>And when I put my phone in slow-motion, you can see them flickering (partly also due to the shutter speed)</p>

<p>I then just needed to finish writing the code (available on github <a href="http://github.com/roadkillcat/BinaryBitcoin">here</a>) and connnect an old 1S lipo from a quadcopter and it was working!</p>

<p>Here are some photos of the finished thing. (the price at the time was: 01111110100110 which is 8102 pounds).</a>

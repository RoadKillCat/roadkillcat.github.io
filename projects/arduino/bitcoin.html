<h1>Wireless bitcoin price display</h1>

<p>Having aquired one of these <a href='https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-huzzah-esp8266/overview'>adafruit feathers</a> which has a built-in ESP8266 wifi module, I thought I'd put it to the test. I had never used the ESP8266 module before, but I have heard a lot about them and so I thought I'd try and create something small that would test its capabilities. If successful, I could then consider using this board (or just a regular arduino hooked up to an ESP6288 module) in place of a full Raspberry Pi setup when I want to incorporate wifi into projects.
</p>

<p>
The projects aim was to display the current bitcoin price in binary over some rows of LEDs.
</p>

<p>After reading up on the module, I setup a nodeJS server to practice some HTTP requests and get the board working.</p>

<p>I then needed to find a lightweight website that would allow me to extract the current price. I came across this <a href='https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json'>coindesk json api</a></p>

<p>After succesfully working out a way of extracting the price from that (<a href='https://github.com/joeiddon/bitcoin_in_binary'>GitHub</a>), I then worked on the LED display aspect. The price of bitcoin was roughly £8000, but having spiked on the 16th December, 2017 to £14,592, I would need <code>14</code> bits to be able to safely display the full price (allowing me up to <code>2^14-1</code> which is <code>16383</code>).</p>

<p>However, as seen in the pinout of the board below, there were only <code>9</code> pins available, so with 14 leds, I would need an alternative method to a pin per LED. I soldered them into a grid circuit (two rows of <code>7</code> leds) which would allow me to scan back and forth between the rows at a high speed and create the impression that the LEDs are constantly on. For this, I would then only need <code>8</code> of the <code>9</code> pins.</p>

<p>I tested the circuit with some jumpers:</p>

<p>I then just needed to finish writing the code (<a href='https://github.com/joeiddon/bitcoin_in_binary'>GitHub</a>) and connnect an old 1S lipo from a quadcopter and it was working!</p>

<p>Here are some photos of the finished thing. (the price at the time was: <code>01111110100110</code> which is £8102).</a>

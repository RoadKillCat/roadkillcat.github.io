<h1>Projects</h1>

<p>
The majority of my physical projects such as my robot arms, quadropod and 3d printer involve arduinos. If you are interested in these 
then <a href="http://joeiddon.me/projects/arduino.html">visit here</a>. Alternatively, you can take a look at some software stuf. The
main languages I code in are <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">Javascript</a> and <a href="http://www.openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a>. You can see my work with these by selecting the appropriate tab above.

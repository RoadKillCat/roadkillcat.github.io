<h1>ARDUINOS !!</h1>
<p>
Arduinos are microcontrollers that are programmed through a C based arduino language. Since they are so simple,
there is a huge range of modules and stuff which you can integrate into stuf. You can find more out about them 
<a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction"> here.</a>
The arduino which I use mainly is the nano v3. It is based around the ATMEL ATmega328p chip which is also found on the uno board.
It has a tiny form factor for what it can do which means that it can be mounted on projects easily. In addition, they are
extremely CHEAP - I found a seller on ebay offering Â£1.13 for them!

Anyway, now you breiefly know what they are, here is some stuf I have made with them...

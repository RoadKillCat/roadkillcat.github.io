<h1>ARDUINOS !!</h1>
<p>
Arduinos are programmably microcontrollers which are awesome... You can find out about them 
<a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction"> here </a>
I have many arduinos (none of which are official ;) ) but my favourite is the
nano v3. It is based around the ATMEL ATmega328p chip which is also found in the uno board.
The board is really small so can be mounted on stuff easily and are extremely CHEAP. I found a seller
on ebay offering Â£1.13 for them!

Anyway, now you breiefly know what they are, here is some stuf I have made with them...

<p> note to self: finish this </p>

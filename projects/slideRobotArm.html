<h1>First Arduino Servo Arm Project</h1>

<p>
the basis of this project was to create a simple robot arm controlled by an arduino (nano) to lift a small object up to the 
top of a slide, drop it, and pick it up at the beggining. Then repeat. I considered printing the frame for the arm, but as I
knew it would need to be altered and that the grabber would be difficult to design, a cut it out os some spare wood I had around.
Blah Blah write some more stuff

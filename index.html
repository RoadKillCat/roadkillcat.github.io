<h1>Hi,</h1>

<p>
My name is Joe, and this website is home to my projects.
</p>

<p>
Use the tabs at the top to navigate the site. The "about" tab has something about me and the making of this site.

<h3>My Favourite Projects</h3>

<p>
If your only here for a quick browse, I thought I'd save you some time by compiling my top few projects. They are:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='/projects/arduino/quadrupod'>quadrupod</a> - a four legged robot that can explore;</li>
<li><a href='/projects/javascript/blocks'>blocks</a> - a minecraft-like multiplayer game that runs in the browser;</li>
<li><a href='/projects/javascript/chess'>chess</a> - a chess AI written in JavaScript.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Having already processed nearly 5 sentences, I'd like to already thank you for reading my work and I hope you enjoy the posts.
</p>

<h3>Coming soon...</h3>

<p>Here's a little teaser, for a <a href='https://github.com/joeiddon/chess_robot'>big project</a>.</p>

<h3>Send me a message?</h3>

<p>
Since I haven't posted any contact details, there is no means of communication here at the moment. Yes I could use a third-party like Disqus, but I find services that require me to login/create an account discourage me from dropping a short comment. So in addition to the fact that I like to write everything myself, I wrote a short (like <code>30</code> line) <a href='https://github.com/joeiddon/simplex'>HTTPS server</a> that accepts POST requests sent from below and rights them to a log.
</p>

<p>
Type what you want in the text area below, click <code>send</code>, and I'll read it!
</p>

<textarea id='input' style='width:500px; height:100px;'></textarea>
<div>
  <input type='button' id='button' value='send'></input>
  <div id='status' style='color:orange;display:inline-block;'>status: awaiting</div>
</div>

<p><em>
Note that this is merely simplex communication. I.e. you can send me messages, but I can't send anything back. Of course, if you were to send an email address or similar, I could get back to you.
</em></p>

Finally, to increase the cat to non-cat content on the web, here are mine:
</p>

<img class='half_img' src='/images/cats/wisps.jpg'></img
><img class='half_img' src='/images/cats/wisps2.jpg'></img>

<img class='half_img' src='/images/cats/kitkat.jpg'></img
><img class='half_img' src='/images/cats/cats.jpg'></img>

<script>
'use strict';
let status = document.getElementById('status');
let already_sent = false;
document.getElementById('button').addEventListener('click', function(){
    if (already_sent) return;
    let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open('POST', 'https://joe.iddon.com:8765');
    xhr.onerror = function(){
        status.innerText = 'server error';
        status.style.color = 'red';
    }
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function(){
        if (xhr.response == 'thanks'){
            status.innerText = 'sent';
            status.style.color = 'green';
            already_sent = true;
        } else {
            status.innerText = 'sending...';
            status.style.color = 'dark orange';
        }
    }
    xhr.send(document.getElementById('input').value);
});
</script>

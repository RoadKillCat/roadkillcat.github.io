<h1>Hi,</h1>

<p>
My name is Joe, and this website is the home of my projets.
</p>

<p>
Use the top navigation tabs to explore the site - in particular, the <code>about</code> section for something on me.
</p>

<p><strong>!NEW!</strong></p>

<p>
Since I haven't posted any contact details, there is no method for any comments/suggestions on any of my work. Yes I could use a third-party like Disqus, but services which require you to sign-in discourage me from dropping a short comment (also I like to write everyhing myself), so instead I wrote a short (like <code>30</code> line) HTTPS server that accepts the POST requests which you send below, and writes them to a log.
</p>

<p>
Type what you want in the text area below, click the <code>send</code> button, and I'll read it!
</p>

<input type='text' id='input'></input>
<input type='button' id='button' value='send'></input>

<p><em>
Note that this is merely simplex communication. I.e. you can send me messages, but I can't send you anything. Of course, if you were to send an email address or similar, I could get back to you.
</em></p>

<p>
Finally, to increase the cat to non-cat content on the web, here's mine:
</p>

<img class='half_img' src='/images/cats/wisps.jpg'></img
><img class='half_img' src='/images/cats/wisps2.jpg'></img>

<img class='half_img' src='/images/cats/kitkat.jpg'></img
><img class='half_img' src='/images/cats/cats.jpg'></img>

<script>
'use strict';
document.getElementById('button').addEventListener('click', function(){
    let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open('POST', 'https://joe.iddon.com:8765');
    xhr.send(document.getElementById('input').value);
});
</script>

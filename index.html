<li><a href='/projects/javascript/blocks'>blocks</a> - a minecraft-like multiplayer game that runs in the browser;</li>
<li><a href='/projects/javascript/chess'>chess</a> - a chess AI written in JavaScript;</li>
<li><a href='/club/snake'>snake</a> - a simple LED snake game that we built in <a href='/club'>Arduino Club</a>.

<h3>Open Cosmos</h3>

<p>
I recently developed a demonstration satellite sub-system for the company Open
Cosmos. They wrote a <!--<a
href='https://open-cosmos.com/sub-systems-for-small-satellites/'>great
article</a>--> <a
href='/misc/archive/Sub-systems%20for%20small%20satellites_%20so%20simple%20a%20teen%20can%20build%20them%20_%20Open%20Cosmos.html'>great
article</a> on our work together which received extremely kind <a href='misc/open_cosmos_social.html'>social media responses</a>. I am really grateful for the opportunity to have worked with you, and to get to see your facilities such as the clean room and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anechoic_chamber'>anechoic chamber</a>.
</p>

<p>
I just wanted to follow up on the experience by linking my <a href='https://github.com/joeiddon/ADCS_demo'>GitHub repository</a> and <a href='https://photos.app.goo.gl/isr3sSZi2DETxmJA6'>this Google Photos Album</a> which includes a longer length video of one of the prototypes functioning.
</p>

<p>
Thanks again Open Cosmos!

<h3>Drop me a comment?</h3>

<p>
Type what you want in the text area below, click <code>send</code>, and I'll read it. There is no sign up required and, although I get hardly any of these, I really enjoy reading them.
</p>

<textarea id='input' style='width:50%;height:100px;' placeholder='Send me anything...'></textarea>
<div>
  <input type='button' id='button' value='send'></input>
  <div id='status' style='color:orange;display:inline-block;'>status: awaiting</div>
</div>

<p><em>
Note that this is merely simplex communication. I.e. you can send me messages, but I can't send anything back. If you would like a reply, mention your email address and I will get back to you.
</em></p>

<h3>Coming soon...</h3>

<p>Here's a little teaser, for a <a href='https://github.com/joeiddon/chess_robot'>big project</a>.</p>

Finally, to increase the cat to non-cat content on the web, here are mine:

<img class='quater_img' src='/images/cats/wisps.jpg'></img

><img class='quater_img' src='/images/cats/kitkat.jpg'></img
><img class='quater_img' src='/images/cats/cats.jpg'></img>

<script>
'use strict';
let status = document.getElementById('status');
let already_sent = false;
document.getElementById('button').addEventListener('click', function(){
    if (already_sent) return;
    let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open('POST', 'https://joe.iddon.com')
    xhr.onerror = function(){
        status.innerText = 'server error';
        status.style.color = 'red';
    }
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function(){
        if (xhr.response == 'thanks'){
            status.innerText = 'sent';
            status.style.color = 'green';
            already_sent = true;
        } else {
            status.innerText = 'sending...';
            status.style.color = 'dark orange';
        }
    }
    xhr.send(JSON.stringify({'type':'log_this', 'data':document.getElementById('input').value}));
});
</script>
